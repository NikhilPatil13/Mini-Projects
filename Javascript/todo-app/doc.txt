1. index.js
------------
Role:
    Entry Point of the program.

Work :
    1) Receives user input(command+argument)
    2) Pass this input to commandParser.js
    3) call dispatcher to execute the correct action.

2. commandParser.js
--------------------
Role:
    Turns user input into a structured format.

Responsibilities:
    Parse raw string commands like:
    "add Buy milk"
    "delete 3"
    "list"

Output an object:
    { command: "add", args: ["Buy milk"] }

This is where we use your string & type conversion knowledge.

3. dispatcher.js
-----------------
Role:
    Routes the parsed command to the correct function.

Responsibilities:
    If command is "add" → call taskManager.addTask()

    If "list" → taskManager.listTasks()

    If "delete" → taskManager.deleteTask()

    If "complete" → taskManager.completeTask()

This file prevents global scope pollution by centralizing command handling.

4. taskManager.js
------------------
Role:
    The heart of this project.

Responsibilities:
    Maintain in-memory tasks array (local scope)

    Define functions:

    addTask

    listTasks

    completeTask

    deleteTask

This is where all your array, object, loops, and functions knowledge is used.

The tasks array stays hidden inside this file — never global.

utils/helpers.js
----------------
Role:
    Store common helper functions (string cleaning, id generation, safe number conversion).

We use utils only when needed.

You may write test cases here later.
